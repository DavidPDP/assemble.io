### Updates

* [Effeckt uses Assemble!](https://github.com/h5bp/Effeckt.css) - a h5bp project focused on "UI-less, performant transitions & animations". If you haven't seen it, definitely check it out, it's pretty awesome.
* [assemble-bootstrap](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-bootstrap) is a new boilerplate to build Twitter Bootstrap 3.0.0 with Assemble and Grunt.js. No need for Ruby, Jekyll, or running a server to view the docs. This repo is up-to-date and includes qunit and phantomjs tests.
