Since custom helpers and [Lo-Dash mixins][external-libraries] are so easy to use with Assemble, the possibilities are truly endless. To make it easier for Assemble users to consume custom helpers created by other users, we offer the following conventions and recommendations for your consideration.

## Conventions and Recommendations
Put the helper in the root of the project. This will make it easy to consume via package managers or methods other than `require`, such as `bower install`.

### Naming Conventions

* **project name**: use the following pattern: "assemble-helpers-[custom helper name]"
* **helper name**: preferably name the helper something like "helper-[helper-name].js". All "official" helpers have been created following the pattern "helper-*.js" so that they can easily be consumed by Assemble via simple minimatch patterns. This doesn't prevent them from being used elsewhere either. 

### Generalization

Oftentimes, beyond being used as a Handlebars helper, the code for many helpers can easily be generalized so that they can also be used as Lo-Dash mixins, filters for other template engines etc. It's worth doing this whenever you can to make the helper more useful to others.

Also:

* Make sure you add a `main` property to the project's **package.json** with a path to the helper. 
* Register the helper with [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) and add a [bower.json](https://github.com/bower/bower#defining-a-package) for easy downloading and consumption of the helper.
* Add a test folder with any tests
* If you want to demonstrate the helper, add those to the test folder as well
